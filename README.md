# Svilf: Stratified stochastic variational inference for high-dimensional network factor model	

This repository contains the `R` package implementing `svilf`, a fast algorithm for stochastic variational inference under the latent factor model for networks.

We recommend installing `svilf` locally in the `lib/` folder, for example with

```
R CMD install -l lib ./svilf_0.1.tar.gz
```

The scripts in the folders `APPLICATION` and `SIMULATIONS` are set-up to use `./lib` as the library folder.
